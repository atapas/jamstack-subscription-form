# jamstack-subscription-form

Let's build a subscription form using the `JAMstack` concept. `Netlify` comes with the form handling capability that allows you achieve the power of JAMstack for form handling.

With this project, we will build a simple(yet powerful) `Subscription` form and submit it using the Netlify forms capability. We will use the `Netlify Functions` to handle the form data and store it in a serverless data store called `Fauna`.
